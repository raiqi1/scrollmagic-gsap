      <p className="text-[35px] mt-3 font-sans leading-[50px] max-md:text-xl">
        is to provide animals with the most necessary things - food, medicine,
        and urgent needs for the livelihood of shelters. We believe in our power
        and the power of conscious citizens who care about the environment and
        their health, who understand the importance of helping each other,
        especially our little friends. Growth begins with your care for your
        loved ones. Animals are one of the closest creatures to humans who
        remain with us throughout our lives. We all know the healing power of
        warmth, grace, and big loving eyes.
